# Connichiwa for Android
This is a port of the [Connichiwa](http://www.connichiwa.info) platform to Android. As of now, the project is by no means complete.

You can currently:

* Run local web applications on an Android device
* Use the Connichiwa API in the web applications

This port is still missing:
* Automatic detection of other devices
* Automatic handshake & connection to other devices
* Support for ad hoc networks
